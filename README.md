2 Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step in the machine learning pipeline is taking a look at the data to make sure that you
understand what you are working with.
Step1: The file was converted into data frame for convenience.
Step2:Segregated the data into continuous numeric data and categorical data.
Step3: Checked if there are any missing values in the given data sets and found there are no missing
values. If there were missing values, then we can handle that by replacing missing values by 'mean' in
features with continuous numeric data and by 'mode' in features with categorical data. There are no
categorical data.
Step4: Couldn't find Unique Identifier Coulmn.
Step5: Checked whether the given datasets are balanced or not, and found the datasets are balanced.
Step6: Found Correlation between Input variables and Target variable. The correlations were not sig-
nificant.
